## 📋 Overview

This AI-powered Chatbot is designed to streamline the candidate screening and recruitment process. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse resumes and match job descriptions with top candidates. The Chatbot offers both text and voice-based input options for user convenience. Users can input job keywords or use speech recognition to provide job descriptions. The Chatbot then recommends the top candidates based on the job requirements and allows bulk sending of acceptance/rejection emails. Streamlit is used to create an interactive web application for hosting the Chatbot. The project aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the recruitment process.
